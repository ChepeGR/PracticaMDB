# PracticaMDB
Practice project with NodeJs, TypeScript, and MongoDB.

The goal of the project is to create an organized library using dependencies such as Mongoose, dotenv, ts-node, body-parser, express, and TypeScript. Additionally, I utilized dev-dependencies like @types-express and @types-mongoose.

Classes were created with their respective constructors, along with controllers, interfaces, and endpoints. The latest changes were made to address some issues in the index file to facilitate API calls.
